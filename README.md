**How to build:**

The Run game engine is using the **MSVC** compiler.

**Make sure you have all the irrKlang .dll files and the Res folder in the Application build directory.** It should already be in the debug compile location.

To build all you need to do is open the project in visual studio 2022 and run.

**All the libraries I am using for the game engine**

OpenGL,   
GLAD,   
GLFW,
